                <p> The K2M Programming Language is an Interpreted Programmed Language that runs from your terminal, and supports functions, loops
                    data structures and much more.
                </p>
                <p> The Interpreter works by first separating the input into tokens, then using an Abstract Syntax Tree Parser to parse the tokens into
                    meaningful code structures, and then finally, produces output by utilizing an evaluator. Additionally, I've included some optimization techniques
                    like constant folding and strength reduction to make the interpreting process faster.
                </p>
                <p > I'm still working on the Interpreter/Language, my plans for the future is to add a blazingly fast math library from scratch,
                    using Fast Fourier Transform, Karatsuba, and other techniques I've learned on my coding journey
