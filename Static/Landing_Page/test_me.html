            <h3> K2M Programming Language </h3>

                <p> The K2M Programming Language is an Interpreted Programmed Language that runs from your terminal, and supports functions, loops
                    data structures and much more.
                </p>
                <p> The Interpreter works by first separating the input into tokens, then using an Abstract Syntax Tree Parser to parse the tokens into
                    meaningful code structures, and then finally, produces output by utilizing an evaluator. Additionally, I've included some optimization techniques
                    like constant folding and strength reduction to make the interpreting process faster.
                </p>
                <p > I'm still working on the Interpreter/Language, my plans for the future is to add a blazingly fast math library from scratch,
                    using Fast Fourier Transform, Karatsuba, and other techniques I've learned on my coding journey

                    I've created the Kynyx Bookstore with the goal of democratizing books and making knowledge available for everyone!
                </p>
                <p> The Kynyx Bookstore has 2 main sections. The first section uses advanced scrappers in several big bookstores websites, in order to find the best deals and promotions to our user. After ethically gathering the data, all of it is stored in our database, compared in order to find the lowest price, and then finally displayed to our user.
                </p>
                <p > The second part uses web crawlers and directory fuzzing in order to scrape public book repositories, in an ethical and legal way. After scrapping those repositories, we centralize all the content into our website, so that we can remove any barriers to knowledge.

                <p > This project taught me a lot about how public and private key cryptography complement each other, and the nature of safety of information.
                </p>
                <p> The server uses both symmetric and asymmetrical cryptography to ensure safety and efficiency when communicating messages. First, the server connects the user by doing a public key exchange, and encrypting all communication using it. Despite being safe, asymmetric cryptography is notorious for being more computationally intensive than symmetric.
                </p>
                <p > As a next step, we send through our encrypted channel the symmetric key, and switch all communication to using the symmetric key. By doing this, we achieve security while also promoting efficiency.

            <h3> Tracker Robot </h3>

            <div class="hidden-desc">
                <iframe class="yt" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNDWJ_KDkAc"> </iframe>
                <p > The Tracker Robot was my first project that involved hardware components and robotics.
                </p>
                <p> The Tracker bot is a robot that works by following around any input that comes into its range. It uses 2 sonars to capture motion of objects, and then keeps following the objects while they are in his view.
                </p>
                <p > By using 2 ultrasonic Sonars, the robot is able to detect any motion in front of it, and rapidly adjust its position and follow the motion

By comparing the distance between what each sonar is measuring, the robot adjusts until both sonars are giving about the same measurement, meaning that they are about the same distance from the object, and therefore, centralized

After the centralization is done, the robot follows its target until a distance of 5 cm and waits for new movement input

                <p> This website came as an idea to showcase my projects and try new techniques while also showing a little bit of my personality.
                </p>
                <p> Each page aims to showcase a little bit of me, while also showcasing my skills as a web developer. The pages are intentionally simple, but they work well and are able to convey the message in a succinct way.
                </p>
                <p > I plan to keep updating this page with more content, and I find a good way of keep interacting with the people that visit my profile.
